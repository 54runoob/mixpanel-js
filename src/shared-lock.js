/**
 * SharedLock: a mutex built on HTML5 localStorage, to ensure that only one browser
 * window/tab at a time will be able to access shared resources.
 *
 * Based on the Alur and Taubenfeld fast lock
 * (http://www.cs.rochester.edu/research/synchronization/pseudocode/fastlock.html)
 * with an added timeout to ensure there will be eventual progress in the event
 * that a window is closed in the middle of the callback.
 *
 * Implementation based on the original version by David Wolever (https://github.com/wolever)
 * at https://gist.github.com/wolever/5fd7573d1ef6166e8f8c4af286a69432.
 *
 * @example
 * const myLock = new SharedLock('some-key');
 * myLock.withLock(function() {
 *   console.log('I hold the mutex!');
 * });
 *
 * @constructor
